Data Professional Survey Breakdown


## Project Overview
This Power BI project presents an analysis of a survey conducted among data professionals to understand various aspects of their careers, including career switches, salaries, industries, programming languages, and job satisfaction. The goal is to extract insights and trends from the survey data to gain a better understanding of the data professional landscape.
## Datasets Details
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the data provided by Alex the Analyst. It contains responses from data professionals in various fields, detailing their career journeys and preferences.
## Steps Covered
1.Connecting Database with Power BI Desktop

2.Analyzing the tables and relations

3.Data Cleaning using Power Query Editor

4.Developing an Interactive BI Dashboard / Report
## Key Insights Explored
1. Most Data professionals who took the survey are from the US (261 members), but significant numbers are based in countries other than the US, UK, India and Canada (224 members).

2. A significant number of survey takers chose Python as their preferred or favorite programming language (414 members), although many respondents also mentioned SQL.

3. Data professionals expressed marginal satisfaction with their work-life balance and dissatisfaction with their current salaries.

4. Data Scientists earn an average salary of approximately $28,000 higher than other job roles.

5.Men survey takers were 75%, but surprisingly the average salary of women was 51%, which is more than the average salary of men.
## Data Visualization
To understand the data professional landscape, I created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard showcases the results of Data Professional Survey Breakdown, providing fascinating insights into various aspects of the industry.

- Cards to represent unique metrics like: Count of Survey Takers and Average Age of Survey Taker
- The Treemap to represents the distribution of survey takers across different countries
- The stacked bar chart for average salary by job title sheds light on the earning potential within the field
- Column chart that illustrates the distribution of votes for programming languages among different job titles
- Donut chart to categorize the difficulties faced by aspiring data professionals
- Gauges to measure happiness levels in current positions. One gauge evaluates work/life balance, while the other assesses satisfaction with salary
